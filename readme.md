# Sudoku Solver

This is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy (Python library for working with arrays)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install the NumPy library by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `sudoku_solver.py` file in your preferred Python editor or IDE.

2. Modify the `sudoku_board` variable to represent the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve. Use `0` to represent empty cells and fill in the known numbers.

3. Run the program. It will solve the Sudoku puzzle and display the solution.

## How It Works

The Sudoku solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the solution. It starts by finding an empty cell in the Sudoku grid and tries to fill it with a number from 1 to 9. It checks if the number is valid based on the Sudoku rules (no repeated numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 block). If the number is valid, it continues solving the puzzle recursively. If the number is not valid, it backtracks and tries the next number. This process continues until a valid solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.
